## What is Eco Tips ?

"Eco Tips is a web application that allows its users to reduce their ecological footprint and save money in a fun way.

 In the current context, an increasing number of citizens are aware of the climate challenges and need to take action in their daily lives to reduce their carbon footprint.
 The country's economic context also leads people to reduce their daily expenses.

  To meet this need, Eco Tips offers its users eco-gestures based in part on a study by CLER - Réseau pour la transition énergétique, helping them to both save money and live more sustainably.

Therefore, Eco Tips provides a fun solution that encourages individuals to awaken their ecological awareness, permanently adopt eco-gestures in their daily lives with the goal of reducing users' carbon footprint. The application informs users about new practices while creating a community of engaged citizens."

## How it works ?

The way Eco Tips works is pretty simple :

- Create an account
- Obtain a card that is called an eco-tip that describes an action that will help reduce your carbon footprint and save you some money
- Then chose a deadline for this particular card
- Once it comes to an end validate the eco-tip and gain some eco-coins
- With this eco-coins you can obtain new cards and go on and on
